# ANN-Classification-Churn
An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) churn classification project predicts which customers are likely to leave a service, using deep learning to find complex patterns in data like banking or telecom usage, involving data prep (scaling, encoding), building a Sequential ANN (TensorFlow/PyTorch), training with early stopping, and evaluating performance (accuracy, F1-score) for business retention strategies. Key steps include defining churn, data cleaning, feature engineering (e.g., credit score, tenure), model training (hidden layers), and deployment (Streamlit app). 

## Core Components of the Project
- Problem Definition: Predict binary outcome (Churn/Not Churn).
- Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit.
